# Week 8

## GIT

## Markdown

We can just write text. It will be a paragraph.

Until we add a line.

We can have __Strong Text__ and *Emphasised test*.

We can also have unordered lists

- one
- another
    - some more

Other lists
1. Cheese
2. Tomatoes
3. Pizza basses
4. Basil

Say to open a file like `week08/talking-about-git.md`

```js
let greeting = 'hi'
console.log(greeting,"Human")
```
